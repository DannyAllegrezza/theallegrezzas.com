                                    <p>I met Sarah in the summer of '97 along with her twin sister, Kelly. They lived in my neighborhood, and were the first friends I made after moving to Greensboro. Sarah and I were also roommates when I transferred to UNC-Chapel Hill my junior year. She is the more liberal and adventurous of the two sisters. We have remained close for over 19 years and she hasn't changed a bit! Sarah is a sister to me and I am thrilled to have her as a maid of honor.</p>

                                    <p>Kelly is my other beautiful maid of honor and Sarah's twin sister. She and I have enough inside jokes to fill a book (oh wait, I've already done that!) Kelly is the more conservative and traditional of the two sisters. Despite their various idiosyncrasies, the three of us have remained best friends since I was 10 years old; we have literally grown up together! Kelly and I have an irreplaceable friendship which I will always cherish. I am honored to stand beside her as a bridesmaid when she gets married next June!</p>

                                    <p>I remember meeting Cameron in middle school. We rode the same bus to school and lived only a couple of miles from each other. She and I became much closer in high school and college, and have had countless fun nights together ever since! Our friendship has sustained many years, and I am so excited to be a bridesmaid for her in September.</p>

                                    <p>Watch out, this girl is a wild one! Nicole and I met in 8th grade and quickly became friends. We became even closer in high school. This led to numerous fun and crazy nights together which cannot be described here. She has been a loyal and supportive friend for the past 16 years, and I am grateful for all of our priceless moments together.</p>

                                    <p>Lauren and I met the summer of '01 right before my freshman (her sophomore) year of high school. We were brought together by our shared participation in marching band. We experienced long (and hot) days of practicing our instruments while learning various formations. She played clarinet and I played the trumpet. We also shared the same enthusiasm for the drumline section so she quickly became my dance partner! We have stayed very close throughout the years despite having long distances between us. I was honored to be her bridesmaid in 2011 and I'm so happy that she will share the same joy with me this December.</p>
