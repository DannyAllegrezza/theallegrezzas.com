                                    <p>I met Sarah in the summer of '97 along with her twin sister, Kelly. They lived in my neighborhood, and were the first friends I made after moving to Greensboro. Sarah and I were also roommates when I transferred to UNC-Chapel Hill my junior year. She is the more liberal and adventurous of the two sisters. We have remained close for over 19 years and she hasn't changed a bit! Sarah is a sister to me and I am thrilled to have her as a maid of honor.</p>

                                    <p>Kelly is my other beautiful maid of honor and Sarah's twin sister. She and I have enough inside jokes to fill a book (oh wait, I've already done that!) Kelly is the more conservative and traditional of the two sisters. Despite their various idiosyncrasies, the three of us have remained best friends since I was 10 years old; we have literally grown up together! Kelly is also a sister to me - we have an irreplaceable friendship which I will always cherish. I am honored to stand beside her as a bridesmaid when she gets married next June!</p>

                                    <p>I've known Cameron since middle school. We lived only a couple miles from each other and therefore rode the same bus to school everyday. She and I stayed in touch and became much closer in high school and college, and have had countless fun nights together ever since! Our friendship has sustained many years. I was honored to be her bridesmaid as well this past September!</p>

                                    <p>Watch out, this girl is a wild one! Nicole and I met in 8th grade and quickly became friends. We became even closer in high school. This led to numerous fun and crazy nights together which cannot be described here. She has been a loyal and supportive friend for the past 16 years, and I am grateful for all of our priceless moments together.</p>

                                    <p>Lauren and I met the summer of '01 right before my freshman (her sophomore) year of high school. We were brought together by our shared participation in marching band. We experienced long (and hot) days of practicing our instruments while learning various formations. She played clarinet and I played the trumpet. We also shared the same enthusiasm for the drum line section so she quickly became my dance partner! We have stayed very close throughout the years despite having long distances between us. I was honored to be her bridesmaid in 2011 and I'm so happy that she will share the same joy with me this December.</p>

He is a great father, husband, friend, teacher, business man and so much more. I know that I can always count on him to give me advice when I need it and show me the light in a dark situation.

                                    <p>My youngest brother Anthony was born only 23 months after my arrival to this world. He instantly became my "kid brother" but that quickly changed as I took on a protective "big brother" role. Growing up we have had our fair share of disagreements but always end up making each other laugh. It makes me proud to know he just returned from studying abroad in Japan and is about to finish his undergraduate degree at UNCC. </p>

I met Chris for the first time while visiting Caitlin at her apartment. She and Chris were living together at the time so I knew there was a good chance we would cross paths. I wanted to make sure the timing was just right! I was testing out Caitlin's inversion table for the first time when I heard the front door crack open. Sure enough, in walks Chris while I am hanging completely upside down! He laughed and introduced himself. I am thrilled to have him stand beside me on my wedding day where he will become my brother!</p>
