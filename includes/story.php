                        <div class="story" id="bride-story">
                            <p>I vividly remember the night I met Danny. My friend Ricky from high school invited me to go out with him to celebrate a friend’s birthday. On his way to pick me up, he mentioned that his friend Danny would be joining us. When they arrived, Ricky and Danny waited patiently in their cars outside of my apartment as I finished primping. I walked downstairs to meet them in the parking lot and saw Ricky in his car. We waved at each other, then he pointed to the car next to him and introduced Danny. I glanced over and saw Danny for the first time.</p>
                            <p class="center"><b>Whoa!</b></p>
                            <p>
                                The first thing I noticed was his bright, charismatic smile, followed by his gorgeous light eyes and jet-black hair. I guess you could say that he immediately piqued my interest.

                                <p>
                                    I got in the car with Ricky, but on our way to the party all I could think about was how I couldn’t wait to get an opportunity to talk more with Danny (or just stare at him…) Once we arrived, I nonchalantly engaged Ricky and Danny in conversation, targeting most questions towards Danny. He mainly talked to me about his hobby of “drifting,” which I had no clue about at the time. I remember asking “Is that like where you drive directly behind another car to reduce wind-resistance?” To which he laughed and informed me, “No, that’s drafting.” We also talked about weight-lifting and working out. He was obviously in great shape and had a nice build!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We finished pre-gaming at the party and then headed to a club downtown. While we were at the club, I wanted to make a lasting impression on Danny, so I did something completely unprecedented — I offered to buy him a drink. I had never bought a drink for a guy before. Danny happily accepted and recommended we take fire-ball shots. After taking our first shot together, I was enthralled. I began noticing how his eyes were this unbelievable shade of blue, and was even more attracted to his dark Italian complexion. He was charming and unbelievably easy to talk to. </p>
                                <p>
                                    I could keep going on but I don’t want to bore you!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Long story short, I expected Danny to ask for my number at the end of the night but he never did! This, too, was unprecedented. I definitely wasn’t going to offer my number and look all desperate. So I decided to just Facebook-stalk him for the next few weeks instead.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I couldn’t get him off my mind. I kept thinking he would find me and eventually add me on Facebook, but he never did! Naturally, I started questioning myself. Was it my hair? My outfit? I knew I should have worn stilettos, not wedges! Or, maybe, he’s just a player.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Not wanting to appear overeager, I had to approach this problem tactfully. Instead of adding him as a friend, I reluctantly decided to “poke” him on Facebook. You can guess how excited I was when he poked back the next day!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After that, he added me as a friend (finally!) and we started messaging back and forth. He gave me his number and I gave him mine. This quickly led to a first date, a first kiss, and a future with a man that I feel incredibly fortunate to be with every day. I get to marry my dream guy!
